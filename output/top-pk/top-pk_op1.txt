Trump is a liar and he'll say he doesn't know what to do. I hope we can show him the bill!

Trump's possible use of the nuclear option that President Trump could strike Syrian airfields with cruise missiles, was a violation of US law.  Trump's administration should be banned from the US for 24 years.  This should be an impeachment issue, and the United States should be required to prove the administration was really serious about fighting ISIS.<br/><br/>Of course, Assad and his forces are not going to take the matter in their own hands and do nothing for it.

Trump's administration has put an awful lot of pressure on the Republicans to do something about it, and I think that's the most important thing.  They have a duty to their constituents, and to act to make sure that they have access to health care, that they are treated fairly, and that they are treated fairly and treated fairly in Congress.  If you can't afford health care, you can't afford to be treated like a human being.  We need to see that.
====================
Trump to get rid of tax reform would be a "huge, huge mistake" to make.  It would make him look bad by removing any tax on capital gains, and end his long career as a real estate developer.  And there would be a huge loss of income for the struggling small business owners who rely on the investments to survive.
