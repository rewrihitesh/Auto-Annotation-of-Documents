# Auto-Annotation-of-Documents
# IRE Major Project

## Abstract:

In this project we genrated the comments from nyt articles+comments. we have used the GPT2 (open-source, a stat-of-art model) to generate context specifc keywords targetted comments.

## Dataset used:
1. NYT articles
2. Comments on aformentioned articles.

## Methodologies Tried:
1. Intially we trained the GPT2 on comments alone to get hands on the library, we tweaked the model to look for best hyperparameter and gthe enrated uncodintional comments.
2. We then extracted the keywords from the article and passed them as prompt to our model, in order to genrate the conditional comments.

## Findings from the current implementation:
